# General Physics I

## Basic Class Info

### Textbook
[insert here]

### Exams
There are three midterm exams and one final exam. While they should not be missed, it is not the end of the world if you do so. The grades of any midterms you miss will be replaced by that of your final exam grade, given that you have **valid justification**. If the final is missed, again with valid justification, then you will take the exam next semester.

### Misc
There are no recorded lectures in this class, which sucks. However, there are also no **graded** homework assignments, which could be a good thing if you're not the biggest fan of practice problems and like to half-ass them (definitely not speaking from experience). Also note that if you are well-acquainted with mechanical physics, the professor says that you may feel like the beginning of the course is redundant.


## Introduction to Mechanics

There are two aspects of mechanical physics that is going to be explored in the class: **kinematics** and **dynamics**. Simply put, kinematics describes motion, while dynamics explains *why* that motion is how it is. Kinematics, for example, deals with the position, velocity, accelaration, jerk, etc. of objects, while dynamics deals more with forces.
