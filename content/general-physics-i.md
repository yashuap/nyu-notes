# General Physics I

## Basic Class Info

### Textbook
[insert here]

### Exams
There are three midterm exams and one final exam. While they should not be missed, it is not the end of the world if you do so. The grades of any midterms you miss will be replaced by that of your final exam grade, given that you have **valid justification**. If the final is missed, again with valid justification, then you will take the exam next semester.

### Misc
There are no recorded lectures in this class, which sucks. However, there are also no **graded** homework assignments, which could be a good thing if you're not the biggest fan of practice problems and like to half-ass them (definitely not speaking from experience). Also note that if you are well-acquainted with mechanical physics, the professor says that you may feel like the beginning of the course is redundant.


## Introduction to Mechanics

There are two aspects of mechanical physics that is going to be explored in the class: **kinematics** and **dynamics**. Simply put, kinematics describes motion, while dynamics explains the causes of that motion. In terms of measurements, kinematics covers position, velocity, acceleration, jerk, etc. Dynamics, on the other hand, deals with concepts such as force.

### Motion along a straight line

Before exploring these kinematic concepts in the real, three dimensional world, it is useful to simplify down and describe motion in the first dimension.

Before we can do anything, we need to choose a point of origin to obtain our measurements of position from. It is more or less arbitrary, however certain values for the origin may prove to easier to work with during calculations. 

The displacement of an object over time is the difference between the two measured points {{<katex>}}(\Delta x = x_f - x_i){{</katex>}} (Note that displacement is decoupled from where we chose our origin to be). A similar formula can be used for time as well {{<katex>}}(\Delta t = t_f - t_i){{</katex>}}. Position, at least in the context of kinematics, should be considered to be a function of time (i.e. an object cannot be in two positions at the same time). 

Whenever {{<katex>}}\Delta t = 0{{</katex>}}, {{<katex>}}\Delta x = 0{{</katex>}} as well (How far can you move in 0 seconds?). The reverse, however is not true. This is because, given a non-zero {{<katex>}}\Delta t{{</katex>}}, the object can move around wherever it wants *and come back to where it originally was*. That last bit is the key to the equation's non-commutative nature. If I told you to stand where you are and then left the room, I would not be able to know if you stood there the entire time or if you moved around and returned to that position later. {{<figure src="http://www.dynamicscience.com.au/tester/solutions1/flight/velocity/animatedisplacement1.gif">}}
