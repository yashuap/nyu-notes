The one we had to get for General Chemistry should suffice.\nAtoms and Atomic Structure # An atom, as you probably know, is composed of a nucleus (which is made of protons and neutrons) and electrons. Atoms have an equal number of protons and electrons, while ions have an unbalanced amount, hence their charge.\nWhere are electrons? # What are electrons? Naive models often represent them as balls orbiting a central nucleus, however that is not really accurate to reality. Instead, electrons occupy electron density clouds that model the probability of an electron occupying a given location.\nElectrons (and many subatomic 'particles') are not just particles, nor are they just waves. Rather, they exhibit properties of both particles *and* waves. The thing about probability is that, at least in this context, it\u0026rsquo;s not discrete; rather it\u0026rsquo;s a continuous property. What this means is that these clouds are quite \u0026lsquo;blurry.\u0026rsquo; If we\u0026rsquo;re talking about a simple ball-shaped density cloud (such as the $1s$ orbital), that means that the closer we are to the nucleus, the more likely we\u0026rsquo;ll \u0026lsquo;find\u0026rsquo; an electron there, and the probability distribution will be denser there. The further away we go, the probability of finding an electron decreases.\nNote, however, that the probability for a $1s$ orbital approaches 0 the further out we go; It never is 0. Even if we are 100,000 miles away from the nucleus of an atom, there is technically still a chance that we\u0026rsquo;ll find an electron from that atom there.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not to say that there aren\u0026rsquo;t regions of space with 0 electron dinsity. Only the $1s$ orbital has such omnipresent distribution. Orbitals with a higher energy shell (we\u0026rsquo;ll get to what that means later) have regions of space, called nodes, with 0 probability of finding an electron there. The figure below shows the electron density clouds of $1s$, $2s$, and $3s$ orbitals, along with their nodes.\n$2s$ orbitals have one node, and $3s$ orbitals have 2 nodes. How many nodes does a $4s$ orbital have? How about a $2p$ orbital? Well, if you noticed the pattern emerging from the figure, you\u0026rsquo;d know the answer is 3 and 1 respectively. The number of nodes is one less than the principle quantum number ($n$).\n$$ \\text{\\# of nodes} = n - 1 $$ You lost me at $1s$ # Okay, I may have went ahead a little bit. I can\u0026rsquo;t just throw terms like $1s$, \u0026rsquo;energy shells,\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;principle quantum number\u0026rsquo; around without explaining what they mean. Electrons are like snowflakes in the sense that no two electrons are alike. Unlike snowflakes, however, where it\u0026rsquo;s technically possible yet virtually impossible to have two of the same snowflakes, electrons in an atom are fundamentally unique, as discovered by Wolfgang Pauli.\nThe Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons in the same atom can have the same four quantum numbers. These four quantum numbers are as follows: the principle quantum number ($n$), the azimuthal(wtf?) quantum number ($\\ell$), the magnetic quantum number ($m_\\ell$), and the spin quantum number ($m_s$).\nQuantum Number Physical Representation Possible Values Principle ($n$) energy shell $1 \\rightarrow \\infty$ Azimuthal ($\\ell$) shape/orbital $0 (s), 1 (p), 2 (d), \u0026hellip; n$ Magnetic ($m_\\ell$) orientation $-\\ell, \u0026hellip; 0, \u0026hellip; \\ell$ Spin ($m_s$) spin $-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}$ "},{"id":1,"href":"/nyu-notes/general-physics-i/","title":"General Physics I","section":"My New Hugo Site","content":" General Physics I # Resources # Syllabus\nTextbook\nClass Info # Exams # There are three midterm exams and one final exam. While they should not be missed, it is not the end of the world if you do so. The grades of any midterms you miss will be replaced by that of your final exam grade, given that you have valid justification. If the final is missed, again with valid justification, then you will take the exam next semester.\nMisc # There are no recorded lectures in this class, which sucks. However, there are also no graded homework assignments, which could be a good thing if you\u0026rsquo;re not the biggest fan of practice problems and like to half-ass them (definitely not speaking from experience). Also note that if you are well-acquainted with mechanical physics, the professor says that you may feel like the beginning of the course is redundant.\nIntroduction to Mechanics # There are two aspects of mechanical physics that is going to be explored in the class: kinematics and dynamics. Simply put, kinematics describes motion, while dynamics explains the causes of that motion. In terms of measurements, kinematics covers position, velocity, acceleration, jerk, etc. Dynamics, on the other hand, deals with concepts such as force.\nKinematics $\\rightarrow$ motion\nDynamics $\\rightarrow$ causes of motion\nMotion along a straight line # Before exploring these kinematic concepts in the real, three dimensional world, it is useful to simplify down and describe motion in the first dimension. Before we can do anything, we need to choose a point of origin to obtain our measurements of position from. It is more or less arbitrary, however certain values for the origin may prove to easier to work with during calculations.\nThe displacement of an object over time is the difference between the two measured points $(\\Delta x = x_f - x_i)$ (Note that displacement is decoupled from where we chose our origin to be). A similar formula can be used for time as well $(\\Delta t = t_f - t_i)$. Position, at least in the context of kinematics, should be considered to be a function of time (i.e. an object cannot be in two positions at the same time).\nWhenever $\\Delta t = 0$, $\\Delta x = 0$ as well (How far can you move in 0 seconds?). The reverse, however is not true. This is because, given a non-zero $\\Delta t$, the object can move around wherever it wants and come back to where it originally was. That last bit is the key to the equation\u0026rsquo;s non-commutative nature. If I told you to stand where you are and then left the room, I would not be able to know if you stood there the entire time or if you moved around and returned to that position later.\n$$ \\Delta t = 0 \\Rightarrow \\Delta x = 0 \\newline \\Delta x = 0 \\not \\Rightarrow \\Delta t = 0 $$ Okay, now plot it # Equations and formulas are all well and good, but it could help if we could visualize the relationship between position and time.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s better. These position v. time graphs are useful in not only compiling an objects journey in one static image, but they also make apparent another key kinematic property: velocity. Algebraically, velocity can be described by the equation $v = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$. And as the image shows, the slope of the lines (i.e. the change in position over time) composing the object\u0026rsquo;s path is the object\u0026rsquo;s velocity. If the velocity is 0, the object is stationary; if it\u0026rsquo;s positive, the object is moving forwards; and if it\u0026rsquo;s negative, the object is moving backwards.\nVelocity $\\not =$ Speed\nhink of velocity as speed + a direction\nAnd again # Hey, wait a minute\u0026hellip; what\u0026rsquo;s stopping us from making another graph, such as velocity over time? Nothing!\nIntroducing acceleration! Just like how velocity describes a change in position over time, acceleration describes a change in velocity over time. The equation to find acceleration is $a = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$. It should look familiar, since it mimics the form of velocity\u0026rsquo;s equation!\nWhile there are semantic similarities between velocity and acceleration, they are not equivalent, and changing one has different effects on the overall motion of the object. For example, a velocity of 0 at a point in time means that the object is stationary. An acceleration of 0, however, supports no such conclusions, for all it means is that the velocity is constant. Now, the object could be stationary if the velocity was stuck at 0, but an acceleration of 0 does not convey that information. All you know, the velocity could be 0, 1, or -40.\nHmmm\u0026hellip; can you do this same graph-shenanigans again? Absolutely! A change in acceleration over time is called jerk. A change in jerk? Snap! Then crackle and pop (seriously).\nPosition $\\rightarrow$ Velocity $\\rightarrow$ Acceleration $\\rightarrow$ Jerk $\\rightarrow$ Snap $\\rightarrow$ Crackle $\\rightarrow$ Pop Unsurprisingly, you can look at the units of a measurement to determine what it actually is measuring (in the context of basic kinematics). Note, however, that the equations defining these properties support the units as well. Position can be considered to be the \u0026lsquo;base,\u0026rsquo; so its unit of measurement is $m$. Velocity is a change in position over time, so $\\frac{m}{s}$. Acceleration is a change in velocity over time, so it is $\\frac{(\\frac{m}{s})}{s}$, or $\\frac{m}{s^2}$. Since we\u0026rsquo;re defining these properties to be the change of something over time, the \u0026lsquo;over time\u0026rsquo; part cascades and results in higher and higher powers of $t$ the further up the derivative chain you go.\nAdding a bit of calculus # "},{"id":2,"href":"/nyu-notes/test/","title":"Test","section":"My New Hugo Site","content":" Hello World # Does the TOC work?\nLets find out! # :)\n"}]
