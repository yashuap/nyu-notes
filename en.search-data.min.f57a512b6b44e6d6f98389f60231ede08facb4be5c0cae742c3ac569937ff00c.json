But in order for them to be \u0026lsquo;unique,\u0026rsquo; they need to have some sort of identity to discern them from other electrons. For electrons, this \u0026lsquo;ID\u0026rsquo; is their quantum numbers.\nWhat principle asserts that electrons are unique in an atom? Pauli Exclusion Principle. Make a chart that states the four quantum numbers, what they represent, and their range of possible values. Quantum Number Physical Representation Possible Values Principle ($n$) size/energy $1 \\rightarrow \\infty$ Azimuthal ($\\ell$) shape/orbital $0 (s), 1 (p), 2 (d), \u0026hellip; n$ Magnetic ($m_\\ell$) orientation $-\\ell, \u0026hellip; 0, \u0026hellip; \\ell$ Spin ($m_s$) spin $-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}$ $\\ell$ represents the type of orbital ($s, p, d, f$). Atomic Orbitals # The traditional ball model of the atom depicts electrons as particles in space, contained in a discrete sphere. In reality, however, electrons exhibit wave-like behaviours, meaning that they are continuous entities that take up space. There is no hard line that divides electrons and not-electrons. These volumes of space are called \u0026lsquo;orbitals.\u0026rsquo;\nCan there be regions of space with 0 probability of electrons being present? If so, what are they called? Yes, they\u0026rsquo;re called nodes.\nNodes are not asymptotes! Just because the probability of finding an electron in a region of space approaches zero, that does not mean it equals 0. For example, a $1s$ orbital has no nodes, so all regions of space have a probability to contain the orbital\u0026rsquo;s electrons, no matter if it is 0.53$\\r{A}$ or 500 miles away from the nucleus. How many nodes are in a 4p orbital? Three.\nThe number of nodes in an orbital is equal to $n-1$ Being continuous, the probability distribution is not uniform. What is being varied in these orbitals? Electron density.\nThese orbitals/electron density clouds model the probability of an electron occupying a point of space, and their infinitesimal small areas in space come together and form a continuous distribution of volume.\nhttps://tracingcurves.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/46a9d-bohrvs.electroncloud.jpg\nWhat represents orbitals mathematically? (Hint: They are the solutions to Schrödinger’s wave equations.) Wave functions ($\\psi$) and their squares ($\\psi^2$).\nRegions of space with $\\psi^2$ equal to 0 are nodes.\nhttps://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/a5e18b829f12622a749e2f131bd029f8783eaf92.jpg\nHow many electrons can reside in an orbital? Does it depend on $\\ell$? Two.\nRemember, $\\ell$ only represents the type of orbital. Yes, we write the maximum number of electrons in an $s$ orbital as $s^2$, and we write the maximum number of electrons in a $p$ orbital as $p^6$, but only when we write the electron configuration. Really, this is just a shorthand, because a $p$ \u0026lsquo;orbital\u0026rsquo; is actually three orbitals in disguise, each with their own orientations (those orbitals being $p_x, p_y,$ and $p_z$). Each of these $p_n$ orbitals can hold two electrons.\nFor a quick formula to get the maximum number of electrons in a type of orbital, you can use the equation $2+4\\ell$. Why can orbitals only have two electrons? Because of the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\nRemember, the PEP states that no two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers. Electrons reside in the same orbital if their $n, \\ell,$ and $m_\\ell$ are the same as each other. That leaves only the fourth quantum number, $m_s$, which only has two possible values ($-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}$). If there were more than two electrons in an orbital, then it\u0026rsquo;s guaranteed that there will duplicates, violating the PEP (see the pidgeonhole principle).\nSome of you may be disappointed with this explanation, since I don\u0026rsquo;t really explain why there are only two spin values. Frankly, I do not know, nor do I think it\u0026rsquo;s something that we\u0026rsquo;re gonna be expected to know. Though if you can find a reasonably understandable explanation and send it to me, then I\u0026rsquo;m happy to add it here. Each orbital has its own distinct shape. For example, $s$ orbitals are ball-like, and $p$ orbitals are dumbbell-shaped.\nFigure of orbital shapes ↕ https://energywavetheory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/K5EcA.jpg\nElectron Configuration # To represent the amount of electrons in an atom, chemists use electron configurations. We start from a $n$ of 1 and an $\\ell$ of 0 ($s$), meaning that hydrogen\u0026rsquo;s neutral electron configuration is represented as $1s^1$.\nThe superscripts represent the number of electrons in an orbital. If you add all of them up, you get the number of electrons in the entire atom/ion. What order do electrons fill orbitals? They adhere to the aufbau principle, meaning they fill the orbitals with the lowest orbital energy.\nA helpful chart showing the optimal orbital energy path. (https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/chart-electron-configuration-each-energy-level-1552589996)\nThis diagram is not without its faults. It is generally accurate for the ground states of lower energy atoms, however many exceptions exist with atoms and ions of higher energy. Additionally, the order that electrons are filled within an orbital type follows Hund\u0026rsquo;s rule, which states that orbitals with the maximum number of unpaired electrons has the least energy. Remember, electrons within an orbital can have two valid spin states ($-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}$). Hund\u0026rsquo;s rule says that instead of filling one orbital completely, electrons fill empty orbitals first and then pair up with already occupied orbitals.\nIn terms of electron configurations, $1s^22s^22p_x^12p_y^12p_z^1$ is more favorable than $1s^22s^22p_x^22p_y^1$.\nWhat is the electron configuration of $\\ce{_{6}C}$? $1s^22s^22p^2$ For longer electron configurations, you can use a shorthand by replacing part of the configuration with the symbol of the noble gas in the previous period. For example, $\\ce{_{16}S}$ can be represented as $[\\ce{Ne}]3s^23p^4$\nWhat is the electron configuration of $\\ce{_{87}Fr}$? Long form: $1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4p^65s^24d^{10}5p^66s^24f^{14}5d^{10}6p^67s^1$\nShorthand: $[\\ce{Rn}] 7s^1$\nThe in shorthand form, the $n$ of the $s$ orbital is equal to the period number. Drawing Molecules # Lewis Structures # Lewis structures depict the covalent bonds between the valence electrons of atoms. These valence electrons are drawn as dots, and if a dot is between two atomic symbols, that means that it is part of a covalent bond and is shared between those two atoms.\nDraw the Lewis structure of $\\ce{H2O}$. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQxRyknIy64\nAlternatively, you can also depict covalent bonds as lines, with each pair of shared electrons forming parallel lines.\nDraw the Lewis structure of ethylene. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bond\nFor a more accurate representation of molecules, Lewis structures can depict the general 3D shape of molecules. This can be done by replacing solid lines with dashed wedges for bonds that go into the page, and colored-in wedges for bonds going out of the page.\nDraw the Lewis structure of methane in 3D space. https://socratic.org/questions/what-is-the-difference-between-a-lewis-dot-symbol-and-a-lewis-structure\nSkeletal Formula # Drawing everything in a Lewis structure can quickly become a pain, so chemists also utilize skeletal formula form when drawing molecules. Skeletal formulas are like Lewis structures, however they omit non-bonding electrons. Additionally, carbon atoms are the vertices of the diagram, and any hydrogens needed to complete their octets are omitted.\nDraw the skeletal formula for decane ($\\ce{C10H22}$). https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Decane-2D-Skeletal.svg\nFrom now on, unless it makes sense to do otherwise, I\u0026rsquo;ll be using the skeletal formula when drawing molecules in 2D. This is rather inconvenient for me, however, since I have to either make or find a picture depicting the molecule and then potentially cite it. Weirdly enough, I found a library that makes it incredibly easy to show molecules in 3D. It is called 3Dmol.js, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be using that for the most part.

As for quizzes, we may get one during recitation covering the week\u0026rsquo;s content, and those will be graded (10%).\nMisc # The professor advised us to get a molecular modeling kit. The one we had to get for General Chemistry should suffice.\nAtoms and Atomic Structure # An atom, as you probably know, is composed of a nucleus (which is made of protons and neutrons) and electrons. Atoms have an equal number of protons and electrons, while ions have an unbalanced amount, hence their charge.\nWhere are electrons? # What are electrons? Naive models often represent them as balls orbiting a central nucleus, however that is not really accurate to reality. Instead, electrons occupy electron density clouds that model the probability of an electron occupying a given location.\nElectrons (and many subatomic \u0026lsquo;particles\u0026rsquo;) are not just particles, nor are they just waves. Rather, they exhibit properties of both particles and waves. The thing about probability is that, at least in this context, it\u0026rsquo;s not discrete; rather it\u0026rsquo;s a continuous property. What this means is that these clouds are quite \u0026lsquo;blurry.\u0026rsquo; If we\u0026rsquo;re talking about a simple ball-shaped density cloud (such as the $1s$ orbital), that means that the closer we are to the nucleus, the more likely we\u0026rsquo;ll \u0026lsquo;find\u0026rsquo; an electron there, and the probability distribution will be denser there. The further away we go, the probability of finding an electron decreases.\nNote, however, that the probability for a $1s$ orbital approaches 0 the further out we go; It never is 0. Even if we are 100,000 miles away from the nucleus of an atom, there is technically still a chance that we\u0026rsquo;ll find an electron from that atom there.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not to say that there aren\u0026rsquo;t regions of space with 0 electron dinsity. Only the $1s$ orbital has such omnipresent distribution. Orbitals with a higher energy shell (we\u0026rsquo;ll get to what that means later) have regions of space, called nodes, with 0 probability of finding an electron there. The figure below shows the electron density clouds of $1s$, $2s$, and $3s$ orbitals, along with their nodes.\n$2s$ orbitals have one node, and $3s$ orbitals have 2 nodes. How many nodes does a $4s$ orbital have? How about a $2p$ orbital? Well, if you noticed the pattern emerging from the figure, you\u0026rsquo;d know the answer is 3 and 1 respectively. The number of nodes is one less than the principle quantum number ($n$).\n$$ \\text{\\# of nodes} = n - 1 $$ Test ↕ You lost me at $1s$ # Okay, I may have went ahead a little bit. I can\u0026rsquo;t just throw terms like $1s$, \u0026rsquo;energy shells,\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;principle quantum number\u0026rsquo; around without explaining what they mean. Electrons are like snowflakes in the sense that no two electrons are alike. Unlike snowflakes, however, where it\u0026rsquo;s technically possible yet virtually impossible to have two of the same snowflakes, electrons in an atom are fundamentally unique, as discovered by Wolfgang Pauli.\nThe Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons in the same atom can have the same four quantum numbers. These four quantum numbers are as follows: the principle quantum number ($n$), the azimuthal(wtf?) quantum number ($\\ell$), the magnetic quantum number ($m_\\ell$), and the spin quantum number ($m_s$).\nQuantum Number Physical Representation Possible Values Principle ($n$) energy shell $1 \\rightarrow \\infty$ Azimuthal ($\\ell$) shape/orbital $0 (s), 1 (p), 2 (d), \u0026hellip; n$ Magnetic ($m_\\ell$) orientation $-\\ell, \u0026hellip; 0, \u0026hellip; \\ell$ Spin ($m_s$) spin $-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}$ "},{"id":2,"href":"/nyu-notes/general-physics-i-old/","title":"General Physics I OLD","section":"My New Hugo Site","content":" General Physics I # Resources # Syllabus\nTextbook\nClass Info # Exams # There are three midterm exams and one final exam. While they should not be missed, it is not the end of the world if you do so. The grades of any midterms you miss will be replaced by that of your final exam grade, given that you have valid justification. If the final is missed, again with valid justification, then you will take the exam next semester.\nMisc # There are no recorded lectures in this class, which sucks. However, there are also no graded homework assignments, which could be a good thing if you\u0026rsquo;re not the biggest fan of practice problems and like to half-ass them (definitely not speaking from experience). Also note that if you are well-acquainted with mechanical physics, the professor says that you may feel like the beginning of the course is redundant.\nIntroduction to Mechanics # There are two aspects of mechanical physics that is going to be explored in the class: kinematics and dynamics. Simply put, kinematics describes motion, while dynamics explains the causes of that motion. In terms of measurements, kinematics covers position, velocity, acceleration, jerk, etc. Dynamics, on the other hand, deals with concepts such as force.\nKinematics $\\rightarrow$ motion\nDynamics $\\rightarrow$ causes of motion\nMotion along a straight line # Before exploring these kinematic concepts in the real, three dimensional world, it is useful to simplify down and describe motion in the first dimension. Before we can do anything, we need to choose a point of origin to obtain our measurements of position from. It is more or less arbitrary, however certain values for the origin may prove to easier to work with during calculations.\nThe displacement of an object over time is the difference between the two measured points $(\\Delta x = x_f - x_i)$ (Note that displacement is decoupled from where we chose our origin to be). A similar formula can be used for time as well $(\\Delta t = t_f - t_i)$. Position, at least in the context of kinematics, should be considered to be a function of time (i.e. an object cannot be in two positions at the same time).\nWhenever $\\Delta t = 0$, $\\Delta x = 0$ as well (How far can you move in 0 seconds?). The reverse, however is not true. This is because, given a non-zero $\\Delta t$, the object can move around wherever it wants and come back to where it originally was. That last bit is the key to the equation\u0026rsquo;s non-commutative nature. If I told you to stand where you are and then left the room, I would not be able to know if you stood there the entire time or if you moved around and returned to that position later.\n$$ \\Delta t = 0 \\Rightarrow \\Delta x = 0 \\newline \\Delta x = 0 \\not \\Rightarrow \\Delta t = 0 $$ Okay, now plot it # Equations and formulas are all well and good, but it could help if we could visualize the relationship between position and time.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s better. These position v. time graphs are useful in not only compiling an objects journey in one static image, but they also make apparent another key kinematic property: velocity. Algebraically, velocity can be described by the equation $v = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$. And as the image shows, the slope of the lines (i.e. the change in position over time) composing the object\u0026rsquo;s path is the object\u0026rsquo;s velocity. If the velocity is 0, the object is stationary; if it\u0026rsquo;s positive, the object is moving forwards; and if it\u0026rsquo;s negative, the object is moving backwards.\nVelocity $\\not =$ Speed\nhink of velocity as speed + a direction\nAnd again # Hey, wait a minute\u0026hellip; what\u0026rsquo;s stopping us from making another graph, such as velocity over time? Nothing!\nIntroducing acceleration! Just like how velocity describes a change in position over time, acceleration describes a change in velocity over time. The equation to find acceleration is $a = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$. It should look familiar, since it mimics the form of velocity\u0026rsquo;s equation!\nWhile there are semantic similarities between velocity and acceleration, they are not equivalent, and changing one has different effects on the overall motion of the object. For example, a velocity of 0 at a point in time means that the object is stationary. An acceleration of 0, however, supports no such conclusions, for all it means is that the velocity is constant. Now, the object could be stationary if the velocity was stuck at 0, but an acceleration of 0 does not convey that information. All you know, the velocity could be 0, 1, or -40.\nHmmm\u0026hellip; can you do this same graph-shenanigans again? Absolutely! A change in acceleration over time is called jerk. A change in jerk? Snap! Then crackle and pop (seriously).\nPosition $\\rightarrow$ Velocity $\\rightarrow$ Acceleration $\\rightarrow$ Jerk $\\rightarrow$ Snap $\\rightarrow$ Crackle $\\rightarrow$ Pop Unsurprisingly, you can look at the units of a measurement to determine what it actually is measuring (in the context of basic kinematics). Note, however, that the equations defining these properties support the units as well. Position can be considered to be the \u0026lsquo;base,\u0026rsquo; so its unit of measurement is $m$. Velocity is a change in position over time, so $\\frac{m}{s}$. Acceleration is a change in velocity over time, so it is $\\frac{(\\frac{m}{s})}{s}$, or $\\frac{m}{s^2}$. Since we\u0026rsquo;re defining these properties to be the change of something over time, the \u0026lsquo;over time\u0026rsquo; part cascades and results in higher and higher powers of $t$ the further up the derivative chain you go.\nAdding a bit of calculus # "},{"id":3,"href":"/nyu-notes/test/","title":"Test","section":"My New Hugo Site","content":" Hello World # Does the TOC work?\nLets find out! # :)\n"}]
